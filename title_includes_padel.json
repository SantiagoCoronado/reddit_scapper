    "selftext": "Hi, I’m hoping to do 10 days intensive padel training in mid September and I am just looking at options now. I’d really appreciate some advice about clubs to play/train at and where to stay. \n\nMalaga seems to be highly rated but I’m not that clear whether it is best to stay in Malaga city or perhaps stay somewhere like Torremolinos, Fuengerola or Benalmadena etc. Could anyone recommend a club to train at and any accommodation nearby?\n\nAlso looking at Alicante which has Bela padel and Pittu Losada quite close to each other so was thinking of staying somewhere near there. Although Bela private sessions are 90 euros for 90 minutes which is a little steep for me and Pittu Losada have not responded to my query about training.\n\nI’m leaning slightly towards going to Malaga at the moment but would really welcome any thoughts/advice from anyone who has trained out there or in Alicante.\n\nThank you ",

Although, I see a lot of older guys and gals playing, it's pretty hard on your body. Pickleball is relatively new here and it definitely gets a lot of looks from both tennis and padel players. Right now, it's more of a curiosity...and, yeah, I think that to some extent there is a bit of \"hierarchy\" where both tennis and padel players have an underlying smugness. But, I've noticed that a fair amount of padel players over 40 are starting paying attention to pickleball as something to seriously consider. Occasionally we get a few padel players who want to try PB and ask to hit and almost all of them really enjoy it. \n\nBut, one thing I've really started to embrace now that I'm one of those 'older' guys...is this: Who gives a shit what anyone thinks! Seriously, it's one of the positives about getting older, you stop giving a fk about what some young person thinks. Like, do you really care that some dickhead thinks pickleball is lame?",

I can shoot off and find a game. That is amazing. \n\n\nPadel..  I'm snobbing on padel and refuse to play that.  No interest in the walls.  The courts are expensive to build and maintain.   It cld never catch on like pickleball when the two are side by side due to affordability and accessibility.   As a one off I cld mess with padel..  but I like digging in and learning a craft. PB allows for that.  I won't pay for padel so cld never play enough and finding a match wld be way too cumbersome. ",

Soy de **Mendoza, Argentina** y necesito una mano con la elección de una nueva paleta.\n\nJuego pádel **1 vez por semana**, de forma recreativa, y mi idea es sumar otro día de entrenamiento para agarrar más ritmo. Vengo jugando hace un par de años, pero de manera intermitente, así que mi nivel es **bajo tirando a medio**: tengo algo de técnica pero mucho por mejorar.\n\nActualmente uso una **Head** con casi 10 años de antigüedad y siento que ya es momento de dar el salto a algo mejor. Mi presupuesto es de hasta **$230.000 ARS aprox.** y tengo en vista estas tres opciones:\n\n* **Bullpadel Onyx Power 2.0**\n* **Babolat Contact 2023** (marco de carbono)\n* **Kombat Hunter 3K**\n\nLa que más me convence es la **Bullpadel Onyx Power 2.0**, aunque también barajo la opción de pegarme una escapada a Chile, pero ahí ya no sabría qué elegir o dónde comprar. ¿Alguna otra recomendación en ese rango de precios?  \n",

You just answer some structured questions about both your **technical skills** and the **mental side of the game**, and it calculates a rating you can use to track your progress or compare with friends.\n\nAs far as I know, there’s no other site that works quite like this. I’d really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to try it out and tell me what you think. Specifically, I’d love to know:\n\n* Does the calculation feel fair and accurate?\n* Is anything confusing or hard to use?\n* What features would make this more useful in the future?\n\nThis is **not a commercial project** — I’m not trying to sell anything. The goal is simply to build a tool for padel players worldwide, and the best way to do that is by listening to real users.\n\nI’d also be incredibly grateful if you could **share the project** with other padel players or communities — getting more traffic will help the site appear on Google when people search for padel level tools.\n\nThanks so much for any feedback you can share — positive or negative, it all helps make the site better!\n\n[https://padelrating.dk](https://padelrating.dk)",

Your nervous system needs to be warmed up, that can also be done off-court. On-court warmups should be for playing conditions, hand-eye coordination and very little else in a non-pro match. You do not need to hit 5 perfect viboras in a row to be warmed up. That’s what training is for.",

I've been just grabbing old tees and joggers until now but would quite like to find a cool brand.\n\nI'm not massively into skimpy tennis style dresses and skirts as this can look a bot odd at the school gates !! But equally wouldn't mind pairing these up with baggier tanks etc.if they're comfortable and flattering.\n\nHave noticed at my local club it's mostly tees/tanks and shorts amongst the rookies like me, which is what I like and what I feel makes Padel so inclusive,  and then you get the more 'pro' types who wear tight activewear too which is also fun to see - like a mini catwalk.\n\nI'm sure anything goes, but just wondering if anyone has found anything fun, athleisur- ish and new that you can grab from the wardrobe, mix and match, and skip off to the Padel courts in before the school pick up?

I've only had one Friendly Match so far, so I'm a bit clueless about the structure and format of an actual Padel Match.\n\nI'm playing in my second Friendly Match this Thursday, and I think I'm the most experienced player out of the four of us, so I want to make sure that the match follows the correct Structure and Format.\n\nCan anyone kindly explain to me what are the rules when it comes to switching sides during a set? (I think I've heard that you switch sides after the first game and then switch sides after every second game until the end of the set).\n\nAlso, will it be fine to Play for Serve to decide who serves first? \n\nLastly, from which side of the court must the first person serve from?",

I’ve been playing for years and I would say that Im a very advanced player. \n\nI’ve teached my parents and friends before and they were all positive about my approach. I spotted their mistakes quickly and had some good exercises that helped them improve really fast.\n\nI completed some courses and I watch a lot of other people coaching via social media to learn and because it’s fun for me to watch. \n\nI will be giving lessons to absolute beginners which I’m very confident about. \n\nI was just wondering if there are any things in particular that would help me? Just looking for some tips and tricks as it’s my first full time job as coach. I also never played tennis before or coached in tennis.. \n\nThanks in advance and looking forward to some feedback and tips 😅🙏",

I wouldnt be suprised if there are people that are top 1000 world that are relatively self-coached. Having a good coach will always be better - but for 90% of players you can still get really far on your own if you put in the work (filming yourself, reviewing film, reading up on how the shots should look). The benefit of getting coached is also that you can get direct input right away. Many times when self studying you are going to \"feel\" like you are doing it right only to come back to the film and realize you are not. Where as a coach can see what you are doing and adjust in realtime. I guess my point is; get a coach if you can - but dont be discouraged if you cant get a coach.",

A coach corrects habits as you’re preparing for the shot, for example… a volley (bread and butter of our sport), you may not have the racket up, you may not be turning your shoulders, you may not split step or have the tip of the racket up, you may not be stepping into the shot (of course there are times when you don’t have to step - again coach can help you to train decision-making), you may not be directing the shot into the best place to play it tactically depending on opponents positioning, your partner’s positioning and your own positioning- these are all things a coach is invaluable for.

Even during overheads, just prioritize getting the sweet spot and angle correct first. After you are stable, then increase your arm power/speed bit by bit. It's pointless learning kick smash at full power if your timing and pose is still untrained.\n\nFor legs, remember the faster you move the more time you have to prepare. Try to keep using micro steps. For positioning, watch youtube on how you have to move with your partner (if your partner is a turtle, then ditch him). Reading wall bounce angles, now this one you'll get better the longer you play.",

To my opinion it can really slow down your progress in learning the typical doubles Padel. The easiest example that I can think is that in singles you have to cover and return balls that based on the angle of the shot are not yours. If you get used to it you will end out of position in doubles or confusing your partner.",

I am an low intermediate player (level 7-KNLTB) and never took formal lessons and feel stuck.  Quick research gave me some options Padel Samui. Has anyone tried any of the Padel Coaches/ Clubs in Phuket or Koh Samui and would you recommend it ?",

Any recommendations for good places/clubs/academies where we could play regularly, maybe join some sessions or find players around our level?\n\nIf the spot has some fun stuff to do outside the court then even better.\n\nThanks a ton 🙌\n",

So I would say €150 to €250.\n\nWith some little extra's here and there, I'm looking at a trip of just below €2000.\n\n\nIf you divide €2000 by the amount of hours at the academy, the price per hour comes very close to the cost of a private lesson here from top spanish coaches in Brussels (€80 per hour).\n\nIn my opinion a pretty good deal. Certainly if you take into account the hopefully nice weather and vacation atmosphere. Hopefully the experience lives up to it.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are better deals to make more south of Spain, but I'm pretty happy and I get to visit a friend that lives in Valencia (unfortunately no possibility to stay at his place).",

One thing I noticed is that both the Active 2 and BIP 6 can already track ball sports like Padel, which is pretty cool.\n\nWith the Helio Strap, the official page still shows “Coming Soon” under supported sports. Does anyone know if it has been updated to include more types of sports yet?\n\n* Will it eventually support Padel (and other ball sports)?\n* Is this “Coming Soon” just a placeholder for a firmware update, or could it mean a new version is around the corner?\n\nCurious what you all think. If anyone has inside info or has tested the Helio Strap recently, would love to hear your thoughts before I decide which device to go for.\n\nThanks in advance!",

There are two pretty equally matched top dogs and it’s not always the two of them making it to every final. How many people do you need fighting for the top to make it entertaining? \n\nPadel is also a new sport in most countries. It will take time to develop top players from other countries and then naturally things will become more competitive. And of course more money in the prize pool will help. That will allow more players to focus purely on padel instead of having to raise funds by other means or work another job/coach as well. \n\nBut everyone getting paid the same is one of the worst takes I’ve ever heard now I’ve he more time to think on it.",

If you can make a reasonable margin on that schedule, you're ok. Whatever comes outside those hours will either just pay for expenses or be a nice bonus. I don't, however, know the northern german market. This is assuming courts that are comfortable to play in during cold and rainy seasons.\n\nYou'll likely find a small club to be an ok business.

The country is behind other central EU countries so it has plenty of room to expand especially with positive news like Germany qualifying to the main stage (Top 8) of the Euro Padel 2025. Just look at the court to population ratio in FIP reports and you will see how far Germany is behind other countries. More media means more people getting involved etc…  i think there’s only positive catalysts for German Padel. \n\nAs far as the location, i think 20 minutes away is not a serious distance so you will get tons of players from the Big City. In most countries/cities padel courts are not in central areas or easily accessible locations due to the land regulation/pricing in central areas. It is proven that people are willing to travel to play padel. \n\nAlso, there are many ways to increase the revenue as a padel centre which many clubs are missing. I have seen a club triple their revenue by adjusting their business model to sell more of the “dead hours”. Most clubs simply follow other clubs in their area… If you get started, look at other countries and clubs outside of Germany.",

    "selftext": "Bonjour à tous,\n\nJ'ai commencé le padel en milieu d'année dernière, avec des anciens collègues à Barcelone. J'y ai peu joué, donc on peut dire que je suis débutant, mais j'aimerais m'y remettre et en faire un peu plus régulièrement. \n\nY a-t-il des personnes ici qui souhaiteraient la même chose ? Et avez-vous l'habitude de jouer en club, ou bien dans les quelques salles qui louent des terrains de padel ? (je sais qu'il y en a une à St Herblain, je crois qu'il y en a une vers Carquefou, pour le reste je ne sais pas trop) 🙂\n\nP.S.: si certaines personnes n'ont jamais joué mais voudraient essayer, c'est avec plaisir, évidemment !\n",

Il y en a une à St Herblain (proche de la ligne 1), il me semble que c'est 10€/personne.

La medida y peso de la bola son variables y se suele golpear la bola con la mano. A veces se usa un guante. Está también el juego de pelota mesoamericano y he visto figurillas de barro que representan personas que podría parecer están practicando algo parecido al béisbol, así que tal vez haya un componente cultural.\n\nEn lo personal no me gusta.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’m a low-intermediate player and have been playing with my Adidas RX Lime so far. I know it’s not the best racket, but I haven’t committed to an upgrade yet. Since I play with a small group, I don’t really have the option of trying out different rackets, so I’m hoping for some advice.\n\nI prefer control, usually play on the right side, and really like the rough surface of the Adidas Team rackets. I’m not set on sticking with Adidas, so I’m open to other brands as well. Ideally, I’d like a control-focused racket with a rough surface that will support my progression.\n\nSo far, I’ve looked into the Babolat Counter Viper and the Nox ML10 Quantum 3K. My concerns are that the Counter Viper might feel too hard, and I’ve also heard of durability issues with some Nox rackets. I did get the chance to try the Counter Vertuo, which felt good, but I was disappointed it didn’t have a rough surface. I know some people say rough surfaces don’t make much difference, but I’ve come to like the feel.\n\nAny suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

I have spoken about Nox durability before but I’ve now owned Head, Wilson and Adidas rackets and they haven’t been too dissimilar. After all those, I ended up upgrading to the ML10 Quantum 3k, which I now use nearly most of the time, on the right and defensive, but has enough power for me to keep learning my attacking shots. Finally, for the price point it’s currently at, I don’t think it can be beaten.",

After rehabbing my knee, I am going to try my hand at Padel after it got recommended to me by my physical therapist.\n\nI was looking at Padel shoes online, but there are an incredible amount of options. I was hoping someone with a bit more experience could give me some advice.\n\nI'm a pretty tall and kind of heavy guy (knee injury added some unwanted weight..), so I guess I'll need good cushioning. Does anyone have any shoe recommendations for a beginning Padel player? Since I'm just starting to play, I don't think I'd want to go for the most expensive shoes right away.\n\nI will be playing on an outdoor court.\n\nI could also start off in my basketball shoes, but I don't know if that would work well on the surface of a Padel court.\n\nI'd love to hear from you guys!

No harm in trying different partners who are up for trying it out, it’s all good learning of what works / what doesn’t for you. In my experience, everyone who’s entered tournaments are already paired up. That’s not to say it’s not possible but you’d have to hope there’s another who does the same.",

You can end up with level 4’s who have no idea how to actually play just because they’ve hit with same group of mates. \nI would say Grade 5’s are for players who do well at club level and want an entry into the competitive environment. Don’t necessarily have to be beating everyone at your club but certainly handy enough. Don’t be afraid to enter them though it’s all experience and sometimes a good measure of where you’re at level wise.",

I can join in on sessions with you and your wife if my schedule permits.\n\nAs for beginner friendly locations, it varies on your budget (average has been around $32/person without membership) and tolerance to outdoor heat or low ceiling (for indoor courts)\n\n* Champions (Doral) has a larger pool of beginner level players,\n* Reserve, Padel X, and Ultra (all Miami locations) are the most expensive to play there\n* Dixson (Deerfield Beach), \n\nThe least expensive courts ($13-20 per player) are mostly at off peak times and/or weekends\n\n* One indoor ($16 on Saturday & Sunday)\n* Champions ($16 on Sunday) \n* Canas racket ($18)\n* Real padel ($14 + $6 Street parking because Miami)\n* Pulse ($10-20, but hardly anyone books there for whatever strange reason)",

There's one that popped up on the playbypoint map called Crown Padel Club in Pembroke Pines, but no construction has happened there. Beyond that there's Legio GP (outdoor, playtomic), Dixson (indoor, playtomic), 10by20 (indoor, playtomic), and Urban Padel (indoor, playtomic)",

I like to place a bag flat so that I can place things inside easily, and oftentimes need to put it on the ground. \n\nI prefer to have straps on the side that opens fully. Alternative of course would be to keep it always upright and only the shoe department would get dirty, or not mind any dirt.\n\nI currently prefer Volt’s black bag as the interior is yellow so easy to see stuff  compared to my previous that had black interior. That doesn’t have thermo pockets but I have managed without. I bought my last one on sale for similar price than that Oxdog now. ",

I can fit my exchange clothes, big and small towel in a bag, glasses, toiletry bag, two to three spare t-shirts, two water bottles, ball tube or pascal box, exercise band, bottle of cold spray in the main two compartments. About 10 overgrips, snacks, sports tape on the flap pocket. Phone, wallet, measuring tape, pens, on the two small outside pockets. The racket pockets fit one racket each which I have. I have the extra shirts in one of them. The shoes are in their own pocket.\n\nEven winter time it’s been big enough but of course Volt’s xl bag would have more space (60 l).\n\nAt the same time it’s not been too big.  \n\n\nThe Oxdog is listed at 48 litres and I don’t think it has that many pockets so I would have needed to just put almost everything to that big compartment and hope everything fits.\n\nBullpadel at least used to have 56 l bags but I prefer how the black Volt keeps things organized. The only thing about the Volt is that I avoid it getting to sweaty as like similar material it can absord sweat and color the straps a bit in white. But that took almost four years to happen. If I saw another on sale now I’d buy it again. If I had to pay full price, I’d probably buy the xl bag although I prefer the three-way individual compartment of the black bag.",

    "selftext": "So I've been playing padel for a year and gained about 5kg (definitely fat, not muscle - all in my stomach).\n\nThe math seems straightforward. Before padel, I ate around my maintenance calories (2000/day). Now after games where I burn 800-900 calories, I return home super hungry and easily consume 1200-1400 calorie meals. These extra calories have slowly accumulated into weight gain. (And I also tend to \"carb up\" a few hours before games...)\n\nAlso before I started with padel, I followed a low carb/keto diet which really helped prevent overeating. But from my experience, this doesn't work well with explosive movement activities like padel.\n\nThe irony? I play almost daily yet feel more overweight than before I started. It's like I never been this athletic and also this fat before..   \n   \n Has anyone else experienced this ? any advice to manage this better?",

        "body": "Well why are you eating 1400 kcal meals after playing padel? That does not sound like a padel specific issue. \n\nThere is probably not a need to eat a full meal before and another 1,5 meal after playing a game.\n\nHow about you eat half a meal (400-600kcal) before and another half a meal after (400-600kcal). Then you have 1300 kcal left during the day (breakfast + lunch), which gives a daily total kcal intake of 2500. \n\nUse a kcal calculator (I.e. Harris Benedict with activity) to check what your kcal goal for maintenance is with this new way of going about, then eat that per day in whatever way you like (or a little less to drop the 5kg of fat).\n\nLet’s say it is 2500 kcal for maintaining your weight, you could even do 1000 kcal for break fast + lunch, play padel and then finish with 1500 kcal. \n\n 1400 kcal for a single meal sounds like quite a lot to be honest, especially when your normal kcal intake was only 2000. \n\nIf you feel extremely hungry after playing padel, you could also do like 300 gram lean chicken + as much vegetables as you want such as broccoli.",

        "body": "The r/padel community continues to show off its amazing empathy and reading comprehension skills.\n\nAnyway. OP, it's not unusual. Some people lose appetite after cardio, others get hungry in the same proportion as they exercise, and some folks get ravenously hungry. The same person can get in a very different state depending on a bunch of factors such as adiposity, sleep etc. Since you're currently the sort of person who feels famished after exercise, what can you do to lose weight and switch to a better mode?\n\n0) Accept that some days you might not play your best while you're losing weight. You're not a pro and your performance can take a hit for 3 months. \n\n1) Convince yourself you won't die if you don't eat. If you eat after padel at all, make it a protein shake and 3-5 carrots/apples. That's undeniably non-fattening and enough fuel to last you till the next full meal. Best case, don't eat at all for a couple of hours after padel. It'll be hard for the first week give or take, then becomes normal.\n\n2) Don't use padel as an excuse to indulge. I'm big on this one. I played/will play today, I can totally eat a chocolate croissant. No! Bad! Skinny people get to do that occasionally, you don't get to do that at all. Healthy whole-food carbs only.\n\n3) Commit yourself to lose weight for a set period. 3 months is good. Don't go crazy, just apply the first 3 principles. If keto is necessary, go keto. You might need to play less during this period. Whatever works. Motivate yourself by thinking of how well you'll play with 5-10kg less dragging you down. \n\n4) Stay vigilant after you lose weight. Put the croissants down for another 3 months fat boy. Up your calories to maintenance but don't permit yourself to slide back. Good luck man.",

I would then often eat pizza, microwave “meals”, biscuits, sweets, chocolate or drink soda etc. \n\nThen I happened to come across the book “Ultra-processed people, why do we all eat stuff that isn’t food … and why can’t we stop?” by Chris van Tulleken. \n\nIt made me realize that most of what I consumed wasn’t healthy and according to studies messes up the brain to want to consume those which can lead to consuming more calories. \n\nSo I started eating whole foods and ditched the ultra-processed foods and drinks. It takes some time to prepare meals for the week but it is worth it. It is hard to avoid all ultra-processed especially if eating out. I eat fruits, meals with vegetables, healthier smoothies and minimally processed instead after padel. Before a padel session, I also eat enough a couple of hours before playing. \n\nMy cravings for ultra-processed foods, sweets and soda went away after maybe three weeks and has stayed away. I lost around 4 kg in the first four weeks back then and some more after that. I was more like skinny-fat body type. \n\nI have now more energy and better blood results, and as you have also noticed it is so much easier to move around the padel court without the extra weight. \n\nIf you are interested in the topic there are short videos in YouTube about ultra-processed foods and why it may be a good thing to avoid them. There were also study results recently published which seemed to involve Chris and the team. ",

The key is to fuel your body *when* you're burning energy, not after. \n\nIt is counterintuitive, but drinking a carb heavy sports drink during exercise will make it easier to stay lean: it will leave you with less of a glycogen deficit afterwards, so you won't develop such uncontrollable cravings.\n\nIt will also increase the intensity of your workout, since your body gets the signal that there's no need to safeguard energy reserves, there's plenty to burn.\n\nSimple sugar + salt in your water bottles works wonders, about 2,5g of salt and 50-150g of sugar per hour depending on what you burn and what you can stomach. It's not especially tasty so you won't overindulge, and you will definitely not crave anything sweet afterwards.",

I built a platform called [**Courtskill.com**](https://courtskill.com/) that collects the *best* professional tennis & padel training videos — and makes them free, organized, and easy to find.\n\n👉 What you can do on Courtskill:\n\n* Browse **high-quality training content** for tennis & padel (forehand, backhand, volleys, serve, footwork, drills & more).\n* Filter by **difficulty level** (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n* Discover **community-recommended tutorials** — the best content gets upvoted.\n* Share your own favorite YouTube training videos to help others improve.\n\nYou don’t need to sign in, but if you do, you’ll get personalized recommendations based on your playstyle and can create and publish your own playslists and videos from youtube you found helpful.\n\nI started Courtskill because I felt like finding *structured, professional, and free training content* online was way too messy — buried under random clips or clickbait.

If my rating is 3.5 but I haven't beaten any pair with an average rating of more than 2.8, then how do I actually know that this increased padel rating makes sense for me?\n\nMy padel rating system (let's call it \"true padel rating\") is based on whatever's the highest of\n\nA) 100 percent of average rating of strongest opponents who I have beaten (e.g 3.5 and 3.7 would be 3.6)\n\nB) 90 percent of average rating of opponents I have drawn with (3.5 and 3.7 would be 3.6 x0.9 = 3.24)\n\nC) 75 percent of average rating of opponents I've lost to but taken a set from (3.6 x 0.75 = 2.7)\n\nThere would be some adjustment required based on your partners rating though, (where if your partners rating is higher than yours/your opponents, the TPR would go down) I'm not a mathematician so don't have full formula worked out.\n\nThe purpose really is to try and give a more accurate measure about results against your strongest opponents. The idea being that if you can take a set off a strong pair then your rating should reflect that, rather than continue to go down if you get paired with weaker partners in other games)\n\nTLDR \nIdea for padel rating system based on weighted  strength of opponents beaten/drawn with. Can go up if stronger opponents are beaten later\n\n\n\n",

Fundamentally you look at the ratings and determine who should win statistically  - and the rating changes based on that - with in a reliability score factored in.\n\nIf the favourites win, they should receive a small increase in score and the loser a small decrease.\n\nIf the underdogs win, they should receive a larger increase in score - and the losers a large decrease. I use small and large as relative terms here - relative to the reliability of their rating.\n\nThe issues about voluntary matchmaking and team internal differences are really universal issues about padel rating, which has to be tackled by ANY rating system. How do you read from the raw results  if one player was carrying his partner? You don't. How do you force people to play against people of almost exactly their own level (forced matchmaking) in a sport where court booking and time is key? You don't.\n\nI understand the problem you are trying to tackle. If I am ratings-focused psycho, I could keep signing up to matches I am almost certain to win, and my score keeps going up, albeit with very small steps after a while. So yes, it is possible to game the system. The only way around that is to either not receive a score at all if the level difference is large enough - or forced matchmaking.",

I built a platform called [**Courtskill.com**](https://courtskill.com) that collects the *best* professional tennis & padel training videos — and makes them free, organized, and easy to find.\n\n👉 What you can do on Courtskill:\n\n* Browse **high-quality training content** for tennis & padel (forehand, backhand, volleys, serve, footwork, drills & more).\n* Filter by **difficulty level** (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n* Discover **community-recommended tutorials** — the best content gets upvoted.\n* Share your own favorite YouTube training videos to help others improve.\n\nYou don’t need to sign in, but if you do, you’ll get personalized recommendations based on your playstyle and can create and publish your own playslists and videos from youtube you found helpful.\n\nI started Courtskill because I felt like finding *structured, professional, and free training content* online was way too messy — buried under random clips or clickbait. Now everything’s in one place, and it’s shaped by the community of players.\n\nI’d love for you to check it out, give it a try, and let me know what you think. 🚀  \nYour feedback will help make it better for all tennis & padel enthusiasts.\n\n👉 [Courtskill.com](https://courtskill.com)\n\nSee you on the court! 🎾✨",

I bought them ~ one year ago and played ~200-250 times. The shoes still look and feel like new, but I am a bit worried that they have been worn out and have some “invisible” negative effect. \n\nWhat’s your approach to buying a new pair? ",

Some people may notice the cushioning gets less and feel more knee or ankle pain....but you can also replace the insoles to new supportive ones to extend the life of the shoe.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I’m looking for my first serious racket and I’ve been checking out the Babolat 2025 series. I’d say I’m around intermediate level. I usually play on the left side(but not always), I like to run a lot, go up to the net, take volleys early, and put a ton of energy into my game. I like balanced racket(not like head heavy rackets)\n\nI was thinking about the Veron AIR or the Veron COUNTER. I don’t really want a full fiberglass racket because it feels a bit too soft for me. The AIR caught my attention because I heard it’s powerful, super light, and gives a different kind of feel—so I thought it might stop my shots from feeling too soft. On the other hand, I’ve also read that the COUNTER is really powerful too, so now I’m kind of stuck between the two.\n\nI know the Viper is considered better by a lot of people, but honestly, I don’t think there’s such a huge difference between the Viper and the Veron when it comes to softness.\n\nI am open to every racket brand, i do not have so much experience with so many different brands, I though Babolat first because its one of the popular brand!\n\nWhat is your thoughts on this? What is your racket, you guys enjoy a lot? Thanks in advance!",

        "body": "Power/Control is a false dichotomy in my experience. The real tradeoffs are  power/manoeuvrability, and control/forgiveness. I personally play with extremely powerful, precise diamond rackets that can put the ball on a dime if I do my job. They are however very heavy to swing and  if I mishit by a millimetre who knows where the ball's going. They're silly and stupid and I love them, but they don't help me win games.\n\nThe real choices you need to make: Do you want a racket that complements your strengths, or covers for your weaknesses? And what are those, exactly? Are you playing to win or playing to have fun? Do you feel limited or hamstrung by your current setup? What's the weather going to be like in the next 6 months? Any injuries you need to account for?\n\nAfter that needs analysis, the right racket characteristics should be somewhat obvious. All this said, a good player will knock our socks off with a frying pan. Gear is very rarely the deciding factor for any player.",

I am not talking about the near future but 10-20-30 years later. Humans evolve and get better at things, look at the 100m sprint times over the course of decades for example.\n\nI expect to see prof players to do, what Tapia and Coello do these days, with ease in the future. How will this impact the game? Maybe there will be new defence strategies, the game will change to playing without lobs, or maybe the rules will change to rule out some shots or tactics, or maybe the court will be made bigger.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

It takes a lot of initiative to turn a project like this into a functional tool.\n\n\n\nYou've already identified the main area for improvement: weight. It's the classic engineering challenge of balancing strength, performance, and mass.\n\n\n\nI've got a great idea to share with you: analyze old paddle designs. Their teardrop shape and overall geometry were brilliant for maximizing a wide sweet spot while minimizing weight and improving aerodynamics. Studying the design, rendering it with strategic use of holes in the face, and re-producing it could be a huge help for your next version.\n\n\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing how you progress with this. If you make new versions or improvements, I'd love to see them. I wish you the best of luck with your development!\n\n\n\nI hope we can continue sharing knowledge.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI play padel 4 times a week, about 1.5–2 hours per session. I am a right-side player with a defensive style, I focus on control, quick recoveries, and staying solid in the back court.\n\nI currently have Asics Gel-Resolution 9 Padel, but I am looking to upgrade as they are reaching their end of life 😅. \n\nI am hesitating between the Asics Gel-Resolution X Padel and the Asics Gel-Challenger 15 Padel.\n\nKey points for me:\n\t•\tI want maximum stability and ankle support to help my defense.\n\t•\tI have had some calf tightness in the past, so comfort and shock absorption are important.\n\t•\tDurability matters since I play a lot.\n\t•\tI do not mind a slightly heavier shoe if it gives me more stability, but I also do not want to feel too slow.\n\nFrom what I understand:\n\t•\tGel-Resolution X → more stable, more durable, heavier.\n\t•\tGel-Challenger 15 → lighter, more agile, maybe less supportive.\n\nHas anyone here played with both models for padel?\nHow big is the difference in stability vs agility between them?\n\nAlso, if anyone has tips on the best insoles to pair with either shoe to reduce calf fatigue, I would love to hear them!\n\nThanks in advance 🙌",

I think it is as they have that lateral support. Now after some time of use I can wear them for 4 hours of play (yes lol this week I did that). After noticing the pain in the beginning of shoes life cycle I started putting the insoles so that they are more in the inner feet. I believe this helped a bit.\n\nThey are a bit heavy vs my previous babolat jet premura 2 that were excellent shoes but they broke in around 2 to 3 months. Before those I had asics lima ff (?) shoes for around 1,5 years. They were better than the gel res x as they are lighter due to less support.

For instance, I wanted to strengthen my legs and shoulders, so I do a lot of deadlifting,pull ups and squads. I do 4 sets with 12 reps. I also do HIT workouts that are available on YouTube for cardio. Third, I do some pilates, which really focuses on balance and core strength.\n\nThis helped me a lot, cause those were areas I wasn't strong enough. I have way less injuries and feel stronger in general. \n\nAnyway, I'm not a pro. If you have money to spend, you could look into getting a workout routine designed by a personal trainer.",

It’s also stunning to drive up to on a motorbike (if you go the right way through the rice fields)\n\nJungle Padel is meh to me but people love it\n\nAmare umulas is great as the sauna and ice bath is included. \nCanggu padel (part of Finns) also has this\n\nIsland Sport is great, has a good app that makes booking a breeze. \n\nCheck out Playtomic as that’s the main booking system they use (apart from Jungle and Island sport)",

Regardless of level all the coaches I’ve had are decent, some are kinda tough some are nice. Some emphasise cardio some are more technical. Some Spanish accents hard to follow tbh. Usually similar coaching pattern. It’s sorta dependent on what you respond well to.\n\nGetting recurring sessions is hard, so if you are flexible on times, join all the clubs WhatsApp group and when sessions come up snag them quickly. if you want to work with one coach you’ll need to take what you can get, start talking to the clubs on WA now.\n\nIf you don’t want to spend a lot of money there are group classes at island (via app) and Bali social (via WhatsApp) that can be good for drills. Franco at BSC sometimes does 2 hour classes which are great. ",

Quería consultarles su opinión acerca del negocio de las canchas de padel, resulta que pude juntar algo de capital y se me planteó la idea de hacer una cancha de padel. En mi cabeza todo tiene sentido y es rentable, ya que vivo en una ciudad chica y casi no hay canchas de padel acá y las que hay estan saturadisimas de demanda, cada vez más gente quiere jugar y casi no hay turnos. A la vez de que podés darle valor agregado como un kioskito/barcito para que la gente tome o coma algo, venta de paletas, organizar torneos, etc. Los contactos para construirla ya mas o menos los tengo, y tengo a mi hermano que esta bastante metido en el tema y conoce muchisima gente para traer a jugar. La idea sería arrancar con una aunque sea al aire libre para ya ir generando retornos, y despues techarla e ir agregando 1 o 2 canchas más a largo plazo. Tal vez en Bs As o lugares con más gente ya esta un poco quemado el negocio pero acá en mi zona casi no hay. Lo veo bastante rentable, con poco riesgo y con no mucho costo de mantenimiento. Lo que sí, todavia no tengo idea de los precios exactos para construirla, tengo un aproximado pero no averigué precios exactos. ",

Si conseguís la posibilidad de que sean techadas, y en verano las puedas mantener frescas (ya sea sacando el techo o con algún tipo de refrigeración -lo veo caro-) la rompés.\n\nEl problema de las canchas de paddle es el siguiente:\n\nCanchas abiertas:\nEn verano te incinerás y te mata el sol a la vista. Y algún día lluvioso te quita un par de horas (si haces un buen sistema de drenaje y buena calidad de alfombras, las secas en 1 hora y ya se puede volver a jugar).\n\nEn invierno es el peor problema por vientos y lluvias que te inutilizab la cancha. \n\nCanchas techadas:\nUtilizables todo el año, siempre que no haga mucho calor.\nVerano: una temperatura agradable o calurosa afuera, adentro sería un horno.\n\n\nObviamente la mejor opción es techada, alfombra y Blindex en todas las paredes. Pero si logras lo que te dije la haces genial porque la podés usar en cualquier momento y le sacas rendimiento siempre. \n\nOtra cosa que te recomiendo si vas a montar las canchas:\n- Abrir una comunidad de WhatsApp con gente que busca o se ofrece para partido. Te sale gratis, se mantiene sólo, y te aumenta una banda las ventas. O una app como alquilatucancha.\n- Profes por la mañana. Especialmente carismáticos (por sobre que tengan mucho nivel). Si es copado, la gente vuelve y se mantiene en clases y arman partidos entre ellos.\n- La mañana y el mediodía, así como pasadas las 22hs son horarios donde baja mucho la cantidad de partidos. Si eentabilizas ese tiempo muerto con promos o 4x3 o birra para el ganador, levantas mucho la venta. Un profe en mi ciudad lo que hacía en verano incluso era ofrecer clases a las 22hs. \n\n\nDe más está decir que:\nKiosquito\nBuffet\nVenta de artículos de paddle\nGym o algo así\n\n\nTodo eso agrega mucho valor.",

At the lower levels, they get many wins playing Tennis at the Padel court, with hard shots, don’t using the glass and speeding up the game. But when they start playing more advanced and experienced Padel players, they suffer. So they need to learn how to play Padel to beat those players. \n\nSo I guess, if you want to play Tennis you have to take some classes and learn how to play Tennis.

More grip variation (continental is rarely used in tennis other than volley and slice which is less usef in modern singles comoared to padel)\n4. You would have to get used to changing grip for different shot selection.\n5. If you play single, had to learn to cover whole court. If you play double, the movement and strategy is different\n6. Most balls will be hit above waist\n7. No lobbing unless last resort defense\n8. Distance to sweetspot is longer.\n9. You have more time in tennis to catch a ball, but topspin can surprise you with its pace after bounce. Fact is the spin is a lot greater in tennis\n10. One handed backhand is disadvantegous in tennis. You might have to learn two handed backhand\n11. Serves and its return are important in tennis and significantly more difficult and varied than padel's\n12.

But never the opposite. \n\nWe all know physically Tennis is more demanding and a lot of aspects about mastering the technique are also on a different level. \n\nThis said, there is no way playing Padel will make you a worst Tennis player.

In my childhood I did a one-week tennis camp where I learnt the basic grips and the service motion. Still somehow had those in my muscle memory. \n\n2. I've played \\*a lot\\* of padel in the past five year. Roughly 350 games. The volleys and overheads come easy as a result of all the padel-grinding. And padel has definitely developed my feel for the ball and coordination. WIthout the padel-background, getting to this (modest) level would have taken me much longer. I'd say I've cut 6-10 months out from the process, thanks to padel. \n\nWith private tennis-lessons (ten in total) it's been surprisingly easy to start hitting decent groundstrokes. I can now get into longer 10-15 shot semi-fast rallies from the baseline. \n\nI'm in decent shape but I've been surprised with how much more strenuous tennis is. Much more running, body-rotation and bigger swings of the racket.",

I woukd really appreciate classes and possibly competitions for people with mobility issues or older people, preferbally using lighter rackets and balls like they do in short tennis. Preferbly in a singles court (there are no singles courts where I live, none). I am one of those people and use paddle courts to play it since they are much smaller so it is much more feasible and I cant find 3 more people (so if the club caters to those people we coukd play in 4s) and short tennis is played in a badminton court in pairs to decrease the area. It is an untapped market. In the same veun have chairs with actual back rest in shade so people like me can take a breather and recover.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!  \n(Post has been approved my moderators in advance)\n\nMy name is Sondre, and I’m a Norwegian app developer who loves playing Padel Tennis in my spare time. I usually play in bigger groups (Americano). During the time I’ve been playing, I’ve tried to find an app to track and set up my matches, but I kept running into the same problems: they either required a subscription, lacked the features I needed, or just felt clumsy to use.\n\nSo, I decided to develop my own. When launching my app, I had a clear goal: to avoid the typical subscription model and to build something without collecting your user data. The result is the app **Americano Padel S2** for iOS (Android is coming very soon).\n\nI’m really excited to share this app, and it would mean a lot to me to get honest feedback. It has taken me months to develop, so there’s a small one-time price (but never any subscriptions or ads). To celebrate the launch, I’ll be giving away **50 promo codes** so some of you can try it for free and help me make it the best possible app for everyone.\n\nTo make sure that the codes are not just scraped by bots and people dont have to test a bunch of codes, i will DM a code to anyone who comments that they want one, or DMs me for one.\n\nApp on the iOS AppStore: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/americano-padel-s2/id6746769088](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/americano-padel-s2/id6746769088)  \nApp on the Android PlayStore: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.njaastad.padelapp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.njaastad.padelapp)\n\nWebpage: [https://padel.njaastad.me](https://padel.njaastad.me)\n\nUPDATE: The Digital Services Act has been approved, it should now be avaiable in the EU (and the rest of the world!)\n\nUPDATE 2: Version 1.1 is on its way, fixing an issue with how the waiting players are rotated. Thank you so much for providing this usefull feedback!\n\nUPDATE 3:Version 1.2 for iOS and Android, is now uploaded for approval! I have also added support for entering any game score target fra 1-99 instead of the 3 predefined values.\n\nUPDATE 4: Android version is avaialbe!",

It also seems to be more focused on community features.\n\nFor me personally, I tend to try to limit the amount og accounts and subscriptions, and then also spam emails and sharing my personal information. So when i went looking for an app that would solve my 1 simple requirement; to track me and my friends padel matches, and help me manage our rounds for our casual play, I decided i wanted to build this. in the app i ask for your name, but that is only to make it faster to add yourself to the app, and to display your name in the greeting message.  \n  \nI think if anyone are using and enjoying the broader community and functionalities of Playtomic, that is definetly a better option  for them. I dont aim to compeete with Playtomic :)",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI run the risk of being set on fire for being perceived as anti-padel. But that's not the case. You will if you read carefully the site of our collective \"NON A MON PADEL\"\\[FR\\] \"NO TO MY PADEL\"\\[ENG\\].\n\nOuch, that's where the problem may start with the name of our collective. So I owe you an explanation if you're still reading it:\n\nThe MON (MY) makes all the difference with a simple and definitive \"NO TO PADEL\". The MON (MY) comes from the feeling of being quite alone (that is \"My\" cross) and maybe even the feeling of guilt we sometimes get from others who don't understand why we're so affected (they don't see the problem because they're not 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year in close proximity to the noise disaster that is outdoor padels without acoustic barriers close to homes). It expresses our very personal distress and our sense of isolation in the face of what nobody seems to understand. It's not a \"no to padel\", but a \"no to certain padel clubs\". But the MON (MY) also carries a hope, that of getting players on board. Yes, I know that some may be dubious, but the MON (MY) also expresses the desire to players to understand this and take responsibility. Something like this: I understand the approach of this collective and I too adhere to the analysis \"No to MY padel if it's not respectful of the environment\", \"if it's not studied so that I can let off steam without causing harm to others, I'll go to another one that is\"...\n\nThat's why I'm risking this message here. For those who have the time to really read us on the web site (that I can't link in this forum, but you could find it with a search engine), I'd like to know your feelings about what we call \"our analysis and our claims\": understanding or not, hateful or benevolent, I'll take it all.   \n  \nIn short, what do you think of us?\n\nKind regards",

        "body": "Possibly slightly off what you asked for, but I think it is more relevant than a stationary bike and a rubber mat for stretching....\n\nI have played at many venues and observed a clear trend:\n\nIf you want to have a vibrant community which brings in additional revenue, you need to have:\n\n\\- A manned shop (even just for beer, coffee). Food is even better.\n\n\\- A place where people can sit and watch the courts - and talk.\n\nYou want people to spend another half an hour or hour, outside of their court time. It makes it a better experience - and you make more revenue as a venue.\n\nI'll give you two examples:\n\n\\*\\*Tio Tio, Berlin\\*\\*\n\nA parking garage rooftop padel venue with 5 courts, where they always have staff manning the shop. They sell drinks and host tournaments, events - and they have a nice seated area directed at the courts, where people can sit and watch the games.\n\nI would guess that the average additional spend (outside court cost) is 2-3EUR per person.\n\n# Nick Club Padel, Barcelona\n\n8 outdoor courts in beautiful surroundings, with a full bar and kitchen. Always vibrant on the evenings and weekends. I even saw other types of events (birthdays?) hosted there.\n\nThe places have the social element in common, which means there are often people there who are not even playing padel, but just having a snack or watching friends/family play. It is an outing, something to do for a Sunday afternoon. The average ADDITIONAL spend per person is probably \\~5 EUR, even with low Spanish prices, would be my guess.",

Is the fencing easy to repair? \n\nAnd how do the installation and upkeep compare to something like a hard court for tennis?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s had experience either playing regularly or even being involved in the installation of one. \n\nWhat should someone really know before investing time, money, or space into a padel court?\n\nThanks in advance, looking forward to hearing your insights.",

But I was playing padel and the only way I can describe it is half way through a game, I felt something in my ankle, as if i needed to “crack” it. So I tried rotating my ankle to get it to crack or pop and hoped it went back to normal. I didn’t get the crack in the ankle I was hoping for but it didn’t hurt or bother me playing for the rest of the game. A few hours later after getting home my ankle started really hurting (only) when laid down on the sofa with my ankle twisting inwards. In every other position it’s fine but when I twist my foot inwards it feels as if something in my ankle and something further up my leg closer to the outer shin wants to snap. It’s like just a very sharp pain. But only when I put my foot and ankle imwards. Has anyone ever had anything similar or can offer me any advice, other than RICE? Sorry that I’ve made the post probably unreadable due to my really bad explanation but it’s literally the only way I can explain it. Thank you for reading and thank you for any bit of future advice ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nBeen seeing padel blow up lately where I live (London, UK), and it got me wondering… if someone wanted to start selling stuff like rackets, grips, balls, bags, etc., do you think there’s still room for newcomers? Or is it basically all locked down by the big brands now?\n\nWhen you buy gear, do you stick to one brand you trust, or are you open to trying new ones if the quality/price feels right?\n\nNot trying to promote anything here – just curious about how people actually buy their gear and if there’s any gaps in what’s out there",

Did pretty well for my first time, the hardest adjustment was how fast the ball came off the wall.

I play pickleball in the midwest United States so I'm used to going to places that are fairly friendly to incorporating newcomers to the sport. Im wondering what to expect in Europe for padel. Are ther clubs or public courts  where we can show up as 2-3 people with no rackets and join in and borrow rackets? Are people generally friendly to accommodating newcomers, or should we plan to find other people ahead of time to play with? For my first week in Europe will be in Paris in the 15th arrondissement, south of the eiffel tower, if the location makes a difference.",

However, there is no such thing as showing up and joining in games, you need to book a court and find other players. Playtomic isn’t a thing here.\n\nYou have multiple options next to where you will stay:\n\n1) Aquaboulevard has 8 indoor padel courts, and a very active whatsapp community to find players (see my previous comment there https://www.reddit.com/r/padel/s/kmC3OjezpH) It’s fairly expensive but that’s where I usually play. You can book from the anybuddy app.\nYou can rent rackets in a store inside, but you will have to bring your own balls (there is a decathlon in the facilities though).\n\n2) padel 15 (https://www.padel15.fr) which has one single court. \nNever been so can’t help with the community though\n\n3) Sportfield: a self service outdoor padel court with a view on the eiffel tower, with self-service racket rental https://www.sportfield.fr\nI went there and it’s great WHEN it’s not too hot outside. Not sure where to find players though.\n\nThere are other options but much further away. \n\nHave fun!",

It was 10 years ago when indoor padel courts were first installed at three David Lloyd Clubs – Bushey, Chigwell and Chelsea Harbour Club. These clubs didn’t have social facilities directly next to the courts but did have structured coaching programmes, and the volume of users was modest. Going back to these clubs and making it as easy as possible to try the game has seen them double their numbers in the last six months.\n\n>“That was a big part of our learning from those initial three sites,” said Pearson. “Our spec now for padel is a large social area adjacent to the courts with many clubs having outdoor TVs, covers, heaters and lockers.\n\n>“Every single court we’ve launched, we’ve got a little bit better. We’ve gained experience. It’s been unconventional to launch them with limited coaching in the early stages, but padel has lower barriers for beginners. Once the community is established and our members are looking to upskill, we plan to focus more on coaching.\n\n[https://thepadelpaper.com/david-lloyd-padel-simon-pearson-racquets/](https://thepadelpaper.com/david-lloyd-padel-simon-pearson-racquets/)",

Having taught at some fancy schools I've enjoyed learning Eton Fives but there's no way it's about to take off.\n\nhttps://therfa.uk/#promo \n\nRugby fives is a simpler game / standard 4 flat-wall court about 2/3rds the size of a squash court. You're right that it's now mostly played at private schools but it's roots are in towns and villages across the country. It's the British version of basque pelotta and (similarly) would have been played in many little villages against whatever wall(s) they had. \n\nIt definitely doesn't need to be a posh game. And many of the fundamentals make it, potentially, more accessible than padel: smaller court footprint, less equipment required, easier to pick up and play etc etc.",

Unheard in the history of padel (in both men, and women ranking).\n\nIn Tarragona, I was exasperated watching Delfi make a ton of unforced errors in the semi-final, but she upped her game in the final (still making several unforced errors) and overall they deserved the win.\n\nThe top 3 pairs (Gemma and Delfi, Ari and Paula, Bea and Claudia) are providing great entertainment and some memorable padel matches. Lots of uncertainty in matches to come.\n\nI am also looking forward to seeing more of Ale and Martina, as well as Sofia and Andrea as they may shake the top pairs when they are on good day!\n\nLooking forward for the second half of the year. Oh and u/First_Entertainer_87 should really do more commentary in the English stream!\n\nWhat are your thoughts so far on the women's tournaments, and for the second half of the year?",

I think Gemma and Delfi will keep winning against Ari and Paula unless they get injured or Ari and Paula find something new to their game. \n\nFor me the most interesting thing watching will be to see if any of the top players change their way of playing in any way.  Not likely to happen this year but in the coming years. For example, Gemma and Delfi seem to be quite comfortable with Ari’s overheads so should she try to change something in those (more side spin and víboras)? To me she’s trying to hit a bit more rulos this year (just my impression, didn’t study). \n\nThen again, if you have gotten to the top with your technique why risk it with changing your playing style too much. The same goes for most players who keep getting results with their current technique. \n\nBut, as the younger players keep improving and also starting to hit more smashes, it will be interesting to see how/if women’s padel changes in the next few years. ",

At the club I’m at, the pros and better players are so helpful and chill. They love the game and are excited to see more people playing.\n\nPhilly is cheap standard of living compared to SF. Maybe on par with Austin. Might be more mild temp and weather than Austin for living in general. \n\nMembership, looking at 60 per month for my club and know the other I was looking at is 100$ at min. If you play a lot their all inclusive pricing runs 320-400 per month. Obviously other options in the middle.\n\nTournament play: my club runs tournaments every two weeks. More friendly but competitive play than regular rec. that 3rd club I mention that is still being built, ran a tournament recently as well. Very high level play (based on my limited knowledge)",

How did it go for you?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!\n\n\n\nMore context:  \nI'm taking the months off work for this. \n\nI'm currently taking 1 class a week + 2/3 full body gym + 3/4 matches per week and i feel that this is the max that i can do meanwhile i work and have a life. Classes don't hit hard in my body as a gym session + match in the day (specially if i do squats and deadlifts)\n\nAs i'd be off i would probably have time to do stretching and mobility every day and probably recovery would be better as stress from work and daily life will be out. \n\nThanks in advance 😊",

If you also incorporate training sessions it's quite a lot for amateur level. \n\nPersonally, I've gotten much more from spacing my lessons so I can pinpoint what I need to train from what I see in matches than just lessons. \n\nAt the beginning, once or twice per week to work on technique, then, incorporate matches to see how you feel. It's also completely normal to not have a polished technique if it works for you. Bodies and movement are different, so you need to take that into account too. \n\nI could continue rambling, but all that to say, I agree with the 1st comment in the end.",

        "body": "If you are thinking about doing an intensive padel training for one month I’d suggest:\n- 3 individual lessons a week with repetition to build the muscle memory \n- 1 game each day (have 3 days games, 1 day rest, 2 days games, another day of rest). The mindset in these games are for you to put in practice what you learned. Leave your comfort zone and put the technique and tactics in practice. This will give you the confidence. \n- stretching and mobility 7 days a week. This will help you to support the heavy physical workload during this month.\n- soft legs workout on the games rest days during this month. \n\nAfter you finish this month, increase the leg workout time. If you want to master Padel, the physical health is really important to allow you to squat, stretch, anticipate. Don’t underestimate the physical part of Padel.\n\nKeep working after this one month. One lesson per week might be more than enough, but play ate least two good games and hit the gym to strengthen, stretch and work mobility \n\nRespect the warnings your body is giving you.",

        "body": "u/National_Natural7557 I think this question is better addressed to people who took lessons.  Chances are, you will get biased answers from coaches.  For example, you won't get an answer (from a coach) like this: \"oh... classes are a complete waste of time.  They are a scam.\"  (of course this is an exaggeration).\n\nI am not a coach, but I took a couple of lessons.  Also, I'm in my 40's and haven't really played racquet sports before padel.  I think it really depends on your age/skill level/coordination/brain.\n\nIn my first lesson, the coach was saying: \"When you volley with your right hand, take one step with your left to the right, and leave your right foot behind (almost like doing a lunge), then volley.  It gives you more stability.\"  (do the opposite for the backhand volley).\n\nOf course, he began hitting the balls to me, and i was doing a great job... deep shots, in the corners... bam, bam, slam...\n\nA few more days, I played a game and he was watching.  When I was done, he said: \"you did nothing of what I thought you.\"  I said: \"every ball you fed me came perfectly so I can volley it.  In the game, I had no chance to volley in the ideal form.\"  He laughed of course.\n\nMy point is that... yes, you can train... training is in different environment.  You have to build up the muscle memory.  You have to think about what you're doing.  You will have to take many lessons.  I think, depending on your time and financial situation, take as many lessons as you could.\n\nThis is coming from someone who played a fuck ton of sports growing up: soccer + basketball + baseball.  And not to toot my own horn, but I have good coordination and decent reflex.\n\nI would say positioning is VERY important in Padel.  You can be running after the ball like a mad man vs conserve energy.  I still chase the ball like a moron, but I'm getting better.  I take my sweet time when the ball is lobbed.  I look once right before I'm about to hit the ball, but that's because I'm way more confident in my lob.  But strategy/position/technique are the things I personally would concentrate on (in that order).\n\nNo matter... the sport is so fun.",

Played a bit of tennis a while ago, generally athletic, along with lifting and CrossFit.\n\nA training week could definitely help like how people who do camps but over a month will likely be mental and physical overtraining. \n\nAt lower intermediate there are lots of things that simple reps will be needed. God knows how long I’ve spent now on a kick smash and vibora and both still don’t go my way all the time. Vibora has finally started paying dividends in matches after 4-5 months of training. I can kick smash in lessons but it’s not reliable in matches and I need to be rather close to the net. \n\nMy recommendation would be a lesson a week and matches along with more structured group play if you can get it. Sessions with a ball machine are also great to try and lock in what you were taught with a coach. \n\nFor reference I do a lesson a week, have also had some weeks with more intensive coaching, other weeks with lots of just playing, and I find a good balance between the two and limiting yourself to no more than 10 hours in a week. Just like muscles get bigger and stronger when you rest - eg why you shouldn’t lift every day to get stronger, it’s the same with Padel. Padel is also very mentally demanding and you need to give your brain rest so you know about grip, foot positioning, etc on overheads. \n\nYou will get there - it’s a marathon, not a sprint to getting good.",

I don't know. I've never played padel. What I can say is that in my city there are free outdoor padel courts, whereas no such squash courts exist. \n\nAnother popular factor is its spectatorship value. It's hard to see the ball, and squash is a sport with such nuance that unless you've played it at a certain level there's a lot that cannot be appreciated, I believe.",

It is those people who are crazy...and lazy. They don't like squash. They like dead-ball squash. \n\nIt is also a matter of perceiving that they are better players than they actually are... Playing with the 'macho' ball keeps the illusion up for some reason. \n\nEven the PSA is aware of this and had at some point released an article of Why you should pick a faster ball... But they never followed through with any campaigns for club-level players. Other squash associations have also mentioned this issue with little success. \n\nI live in high altitude so the ball commonly used here is extra slow...one green dot; notably slower than the two yellow dot ball. Supposedly to account for the lower air pressure at altitude, but it is not done accurately and with care, so the ball ends up even more dead than a two yellow dot at sea level... And when it is cold, the effect is magnified. When cold, it's like it's two levels slower than a two yellow dot ball.",

Barely so, however...\n\nI'm an advanced player but Im not as young anymore...so even though a double yellow is somewhat suitable for me (unless court is cold), I still don't fancy having to be explosive and over stretch for every retrieval... Bouncier ball saves joints and allows you to play longer without issues.\n\nI'm not competitive anymore... I find just enjoyment of the game and fun is much more important than the rest. \n\nWhat has been your experience when asking others to play with a slightly faster ball ?",

        "body": "My take is based on 3 arguments (mainly based on what I see where I live):\n\n1.  Padel is an \"easier\" sport  to start for the average man/woman. Even with a poor physical form you can get into Padel and keep improving if you like it, while Squash explosiveness requires some physical form to start enjoying it. Nowadays, it seems that people that want to do many weekly sport hours decide to either do running or going to the gym, so the potential new public for Squash is reduced.\n2. Padel is played at 4 which leads up to more \"social plays\". Combined with 1, I see many people using Padel as an excuse to make some sport while spending time with friends. Squash nature feels more competitive and doesn't seem the best sport for \"social play\".\n3. On warmer countries (like southern europe), outdoor events can be played all year and from April to November are really enjoyable. Besides the 3-4 winter months, convincing a newbie to do a racket indoor sport above Padel or Tennis is a hard task",

Just be careful with this trick on the brain, on the back are glass walls... Guess how I found it... Nearly fratured rib with multiple hits with the back in the back wall, when you loose the position on the field and still not allow the ball pass :)  \n\nThen after 2 or 3 games you start to relax and allow the ball to hit the sides and back wall and only then play . \n\nEnjoy!",
